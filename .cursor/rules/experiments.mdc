# Networking Experiments System

When the user mentions networking experiments, help them create and track experiments in the `/experiments` directory using this framework:

The experiment will have instructions on how to modify the weeks it's assigned to. 

## Experiment File Structure
Each experiment should be a markdown file: `experiments/YYYY-MM-DD-experiment-name.md`

## Experiment Template
```markdown
# [Experiment Name]
**Start Date:** [Date]
**Duration:** [1-2 weeks]
**Status:** Planning/Active/Complete

## Hypothesis
"I wonder what happens if..." [Curiosity-driven question, NOT outcome-focused]

## Process Goal (NOT Outcome Goal)
- Specific actions I will take
- Frequency/quantity 
- Time commitment
- What "done" looks like for the PROCESS

## Success Metrics (Process-Focused) (work with the user to determine these, don't just generate them)
- [ ] Did I complete the planned actions?
- [ ] What did I learn about people/myself?
- [ ] How did it feel? (Energy level, resistance, flow state)

## Daily Log
### Day 1: [Date]
- Action taken:
- Immediate feeling:
- Any responses/reactions:

### Day 2: [Date]
[etc...]

## Reflection (After 1-2 weeks)
- What surprised me?
- What felt natural vs forced?
- What would I do differently?
- What experiment should I try next?

## Key Insight
[One sentence about what this taught me about networking/people/myself]
